This repo contains the source code for my personal website, created using **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **Liquid**.  
# Inspiration  
The idea to use Jekyll for a personal portfolio comes from attending a career event at the University of British Columbia hosted by a team of industry professionals.
The team strongly recommended having an easy online method for interested companies to access your full portfolio.  
# Purpose  
Provide an easy method for anyone interested in my skills to see my full portfolio.  
# Challenges  
I had not done any HTML or CSS for several years, so I needed to pick up the semantics of both languages again, as well as the additional semantics of SCSS.  
# What's Next  
I will continue to update this repo with additional data as I gain more experience, as well as update any UI elements as I come up with ideas.
